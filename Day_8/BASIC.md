It is the index . If nothing is passed then column elements will have normal indexing which startes from `0`. It can be used to access any element of the `series`.

### DataFrame

Data-sets in pandas are usually multi-dimensional tables, known as "Data Frames".

- Data Frame is a whole table, whereas Series is like a column
- Data Frame is heterogeneous i.e, collection of different types of value.

## Read the CSV file

- calculate max marks in all the different subjects.
- calculate min marks in all the different subjects.
- apply aggregation fucntion on different groups in the given file.
- perform inner, outer, left, right joins.
- chnage the name of the column 'official email id' to 'email id'.
- provide the name of the students, who scored more than 80% in mathematics.
- provide the name of the students, who scored less than 75% in physics.
- add a new column named SGPA - `SGPS = total_marks/10`.
- add a new column GRADE (A, B, C, D).

this data should be reflected on the file too.
